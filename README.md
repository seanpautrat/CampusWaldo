Campus Waldo is a role-based Android application inspired by Where’s Waldo, designed to create a daily hide-and-seek challenge on a college campus, in our case Cornell University. Each day, one user becomes “Waldo” and delivers clues, while all other users become “Hunters” who try to find Waldo in real life and submit a daily code to complete the challenge. The app is built using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Android Architecture Components, and a clean MVVM-style structure.
